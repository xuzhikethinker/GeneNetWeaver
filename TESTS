0. CONSISTENCY MATLAB <--> GNW ODEs
===================================

[XX] Steady-state
	[XX] Wild-type
	[XX] Knockouts
	[XX] Knockdowns
	[XX] Multifactorial
	[ ] Double-knockouts
	
[XX] Time-series
	[XX] Knockouts
	[XX] Knockdowns
	[XX] Multifactorial
	[ ] Double-knockouts
	
=> The model (the kinetic equations) are implemented correctly (unless we make the same mistakes both in Matlab and in Java).
=> The integration of the ODEs in GNW is correct both for steady-states and time-series 
	
	
1. CONSISTENCY ODEs <--> SDEs
=============================

[XX] Time-series (TS): plot ODE and SDE solution, check that SDE follows ODE curve
	[X] No noise (diffusionMultiplier = 0)
	[XX] Little noise (diffusionMultiplier ~ 0)
	[XX] Regular noise (diffusionMultiplier = 0.05)
	
[XX] Steady-state (SS): check the difference between ODE and SDE solution for no noise and little noise
	[XX] Wild-type
	[XX] Knockouts
	[XX] Knockdowns
	[XX] Multifactorial
	[XX] Double-knockouts

=> The numerical integration of ODEs and SDEs is correct, because we obtain the same result with two different methods.


2. CONSISTENCY STEADY-STATES <--> TIME-SERIES
=============================================

[XX] Check that the same solution is obtained for steady-states and time-series with SDEs with no noise
	[XX] Knockouts
	[XX] Knockdowns
	[XX] Multifactorial weak
	[XX] Double-knockouts
	
=> Steady-states and time-series experiments give the same end point (for ODEs, this has been checked in Section 0)


3. CONSISTENCY DREAM3 <--> DREAM4
=================================

[X] Simulate an .xml network of dream3 (after reintroducing the bug) and check that you reproduce the dream3 data
	[X] Knockouts
	[X] Knockdowns


4. VARIOUS
==========

[XX] Run all experiments, rerun by loading all perturbations, check that results without noise are identical
	=> Loading and saving multifactorial perturbations and dual knockouts works


4. CONSISTENCY WITH RESULTS OF PREVIOUS CHALLENGE
=================================================

[X] Similar results with z-score method
[ ] Similar results with AGE
